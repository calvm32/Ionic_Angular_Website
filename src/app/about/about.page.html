            </strong></font>
        </h1>
        <p class="margin">
          I firmly believe in the transformational power of education and I'm currently aspiring to gain as much
          knowledge as possible in my undergraduate experience. My goal is to become a math professor,â€‹ continuing my
          own
          math research while teaching and providing impactful opportunities to students. I am inspired by the educators
          that have provided lifechanging opportunities for me.
        </p>

          I graduated from Scottsbluff High School in May of 2023. As a Sophomore (Spring 2021), I took Number Theory
          and
          Cryptography through the University of Nebraska-Omaha. This was my gateway to pure mathematics, teaching me
          the
          intricacies and joy behind proof-writing. Summer of 2021 I participated in elliptic curves and Diophantine
          equations research, then took Abstract Algebra I and II as a Junior (Fall 2021-Spring 2022). I excelled in
          these
          courses and once again earned an opportunity to do math reserch, this time in the classification of Galois
          groups
          with powers of some prime, <i>p</i>, over fields with characteristic <i>p</i>. This reserach evolved into my
          current project, the classification of a specific family of such Galois groups with maximal nilpotency class.
          More
          on this project <a href="tabs/tab8" target="_blank">here</a>. My Senior year, I took Introduction to Topology
          (Spring 2023)
          along with 4 AP Courses. I was accepted into the UNO Walter Scott Jr. Scholarship, where I am currently
          studying
          Pure Mathematics and Computer Science.

          Aside from math, I spend my time creating art, including origami and mathematical constructions. I enjoy
          photographing nature and learning more as I do so. Recently, I joined the Nebraska Mycological Society to
          learn more
          about mushrooms, which have piqued my interest primarily for their convergent taxonomy and the niche they
          fill in
          ecosystems.
