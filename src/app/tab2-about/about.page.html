        <h1 class="subheading" align="left">About me:</h1>
        <p class="normaltext">
          I firmly believe in the transformational power of education and I'm
          currently aspiring to gain as much knowledge as possible in my
          undergraduate experience. My goal is to become a math professor,â€‹
          continuing my own math research while teaching and providing impactful
          opportunities to students. I am inspired by the educators that have
          provided lifechanging opportunities for me.
        </p>

          I graduated from Scottsbluff High School in May of 2023. As a
          Sophomore (Spring 2021), I took Number Theory and Cryptography through
          the University of Nebraska-Omaha. This was my gateway to pure
          mathematics, teaching me the intricacies and joy behind proof-writing.
          Summer of 2021 I participated in elliptic curves and Diophantine
          equations research, then took Abstract Algebra I and II as a Junior
          (Fall 2021-Spring 2022). I excelled in these courses and once again
          earned an opportunity to do math reserch, this time in the
          classification of Galois groups with powers of some prime, <i>p</i>,
          over fields with characteristic <i>p</i>. This reserach evolved into
          my current project, the classification of a specific family of such
          Galois groups with maximal nilpotency class. More on this project
          <a href="research" target="_blank">here</a>. My Senior year, I took
          Introduction to Topology (Spring 2023) along with 4 AP Courses. I was
          accepted into the UNO Walter Scott Jr. Scholarship, where I am
          currently studying Pure Mathematics and Computer Science.

          Aside from math, I spend my time creating art, including origami and
          mathematical constructions. I enjoy photographing nature and learning
          more as I do so. Recently, I joined the Nebraska Mycological Society
          to learn more about mushrooms, which have piqued my interest primarily
          for their convergent taxonomy and the niche they fill in ecosystems.
